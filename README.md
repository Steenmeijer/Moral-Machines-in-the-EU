# Moral-Machines-in-the-EU
This repository contains all the relevant project files used in the MSc. Thesis project 'Moral Machines in the EU' for the partial fulfilment of the Data Science &amp; Society program at Tilburg University.

In this repository, you find two files: one .html file and one RMarkdown file.

## html file
The .html file is the knitted product of the RMarkdown file and can be used to quickly inspect the code and it presents all the plots and figures used in the analysis. 

## RMarkdown file
The RMarkdown file can be used if one wishes to replicate the analysis in this project, or use bits of code or manipulated data to conduct their own research or pursue follow-up research questions.

## Thesis 
After completion and receiving the final result, I shall also upload the thesis project to this repository.
